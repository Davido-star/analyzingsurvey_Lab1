# Analyzing A Survey Lab1.  
David Smith.  
Python 3.  
The associated script calls a .txt file from your local drive and works over it. The end product is a script which prints names of people who voted more than once and the total votes for each county voted for.  
I had minor difficulty loading the .txt file at first but realized it must be an issue with the mac interface and switched to a PC. This solved the issue.  
I am disappointed I couldnâ€™t figure out how to print the county with the most for the last section, but I did try a few things. The problem I ran into was converting between strings and integers from within a dictionary. I will figure this out.
